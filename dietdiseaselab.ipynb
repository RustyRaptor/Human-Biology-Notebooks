    "According to Łuszczki et al., a vegan diet consists entirely of plant-based foods and avoids all animal products including meat, dairy, and eggs (Łuszczki et al., 2023). This contrasts with the USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which according to their guidelines site, include recommendations for consuming animal products (U.S. Department of Agriculture & U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2020). Unlike a vegetarian diet, which according to Łuszczki et al. may incorporate dairy and eggs but excludes meat, poultry, and fish, a vegan diet eliminates all forms of animal-derived ingredients (Łuszczki et al., 2023). They tell us that key components of a vegan diet are fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains, which provide necessary nutrients including protein (Łuszczki et al., 2023). The article tell us that to meet protein requirements, vegans should consume a diverse array of these plant-based foods, ensuring adequate intake of all essential amino acids (Łuszczki et al., 2023).\n",

    "A vegan diet, like everything, has it's pros and cons. Advantages mentioned by Łuszczki et al. include reduced risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension while disadvantages mentioned include challenges ensuring adequate intake of important nutrients such as vitamin B12 and iron (Łuszczki et al., 2023). The article provides a balanced analysis of the diet giving us both the benefits and challenges of following a vegan diet.\n",
