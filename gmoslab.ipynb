    "## Essay\n",
    "\n",
    "1. According to Whitman (2000) GMOs are crops modified using molecular biology techniques usually to get desired traits such as resistance to pests, diseases, or herbicides (Whitman, 2000). Whitman tells us that genetic engineering is more efficient than traditional breeding methods because it can introduce desired traits from unrelated species instantly (Whitman, 2000).\n",
    "2. From Whitman's article, we learn that different countries have different regulations on GMOs (Whitman, 2000). In Whitman's article we see that this is both in what crops are allowed to be grown and what foods are allowed to be produced from GMOs (Whitman, 2000). Whitman tells us that in the United States, foods produced by GMs are regulated by the FDA while crops are regulated by the USDA (for agricultural factors) and the EPA (for environmental factors) (Whitman, 2000).\n",
    "3. Whitman lists many benefits of GMs including Pest resistance, herbicide tolerance, disease resistance, cold tolerance, drought tolerance, nutrition, and pharmaceuticals (Whitman, 2000). Whitman discusses some critcisms as well such as unintended harm to other organisms, reduced effectiveness of pesticides, and gene transfer to non-target species (Whitman, 2000). Whitman also discusses the potential for allergens and toxins to be introduced into foods and the uncertain effects on human health (Whitman, 2000). However Whitman also mentions that scientists have not found any evidence of harm to humans from GM foods (Whitman, 2000).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Genetically modified crop plants are a large part of food production in the US today. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Predicted Results\n",
    "\n",
    "1. More than 50% of the ingredients of the products in the dataset are genetically modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is niacin\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Niacin is a form of vitamin B3. It is found in many foods including yeast, meat, fish, milk, eggs, green vegetables, and cereal grains. Some cereal grains are fortified with niacin. It is also available as a supplement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is tocoferol\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tocopherols are a class of organic chemical compounds (more precisely, various methylated phenols), many of which have vitamin E activity. Because the vitamin activity was first identified in 1936 from a dietary fertility factor in rats, it was given the name \"tocopherol\" from the Greek words \"τόκος\" [tókos, birth], and \"φέρειν\", [phérein, to bear or carry] meaning in sum \"to carry a pregnancy,\" with the ending \"-ol\" signifying its status as a chemical alcohol.\n",
    "2. Tocopherol is extracted from vegetable oils, such as soybean oil. It is also found in foods such as nuts, seeds, and leafy green vegetables, and is commonly used as a dietary supplement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is calcium carbonate\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calcium carbonate is a chemical compound with the formula CaCO3. It is a common substance found in rocks as the minerals calcite and aragonite (most notably as limestone, which is a type of sedimentary rock consisting mainly of calcite) and is the main component of pearls and the shells of marine organisms, snails, and eggs. Calcium carbonate is the active ingredient in agricultural lime and is created when calcium ions in hard water react with carbonate ions to create limescale. It is medicinally used as a calcium supplement or as an antacid, but excessive consumption can be hazardous.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion \n",
    "The Discussion must contain the following components:\n",
    "-a statement of the hypothesis of the experiment (properly paraphrased and cited)\n",
    "-a comparison of the predicted results to the observed results listed in Table 11-3.\n",
    "-a conclusion: a statement which evaluates the hypothesis of the experiment, indicating \n",
    "whether the hypothesis is supported by the gel results or whether the results do not \n",
    "support the hypothesis and the hypothesis must be rejected.\n",
    "-explain how the gel electrophoresis results led to your conclusion. This is the most \n",
    "important part of the lab report because you are using evidence to support your conclusion \n",
    "that the hypothesis either is or is not supported by the experimental results.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our hypothesis is that genetically modified crop plants are a large part of food production in the US today. The predicted results are that more than 50% of the ingredients of the products in the dataset are genetically modified. The observed results are that 0% of the ingredients in the dataset are genetically modified. This leads us to conclude that the hypothesis is not supported by the gel results and must be rejected. The gel electrophoresis results show that none of the ingredients in the dataset are genetically modified. This is evidence that genetically modified crop plants are not a large part of food production in the US today.\n",
